| Criteria              | Meets Specifications                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Report                | The submission includes a file in the root of the GitHub repository (one of `Report.md`, `Report.ipynb`, or `Report.pdf`) that provides a description of the implementation. |
| Learning Algorithm    | The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen  hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any  neural networks. |
| Plot of Rewards       | A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agents  get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after  taking the maximum over both agents). The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment. |
| Ideas for Future Work | The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance. |
